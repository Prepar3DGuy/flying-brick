# flying-brick

This is a sample aircraft for MSFS built from scratch, especially for
demonstrating how to override the "flight model" of MSFS with your own
code that completely overrides how the aircraft behaves.

The 3D model here is *not* intended to be very good. On the contrary.

The .cfg files in particular are intended to be extremely verbosely
(and visually nicely) commented. Much improved upon the MSFS SDK
samples. The Aircraft Editor in MSFS has not been allowed to re-write
them.
