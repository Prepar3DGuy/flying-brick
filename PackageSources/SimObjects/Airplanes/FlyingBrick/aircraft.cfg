Tips0 = The Flying Brick is an open-source sample aircraft that is not even supposed to look or behave like anything that exists (or could exist) in reality
Tips1 = You are free to enjoy flying around in it anyway, for sightseeing or whatever, of course
Tips2 = If you keep your throttle centered, and assuming your yoke or control stick is auto-centering, the thing will float still in air
Tips3 = Push your stick or yoke forward, and it goes forward. Pull it back, and it goes backward
Tips4 = Push your stick or yoke sidewards, and it goes sideward
Tips5 = Use your rudder pedals (or twist your joystick) to rotate around the vertical axis
Tips6 = Use the throttle to control ascent and descent
Tips7 = Patches welcome
Tips8 = If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces
